> **A local-first home for your agent's skills, knowledge, and experience.**
> Use it with Claude Code, Cursor, or OpenCode — your data stays in your repo, your skills follow you across hosts, and the system gets a little sharper every time you ship something.

`garage-agent` is built for **solo creators** who refuse to choose between "stuck in one IDE forever" and "starting from scratch every conversation". It treats your agent capability as something you grow over time — sessions become memories, memories become skills, skills become packs, and packs travel with you.

## Why garage-agent

| | Without garage-agent | With garage-agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Your data** | Locked inside one host's session DB | Plain files under `.garage/` in your own repo |
| **Switching hosts** | Re-teach everything from scratch | One `garage init --hosts <new-host>` and your skills + memory follow |
| **What you've learned** | Disappears when the conversation ends | Auto-extracted into `knowledge/` and `experience/`, reviewed by you |
| **Sharing capability** | Copy-paste prompts into a Notion page | `garage pack publish --to <git-url>` with anonymization + provenance |
| **The garage promise** | A black box with a chat field | A workshop you can read, modify, and pass on |

## Features

- **Local-first by design** — Every session, knowledge entry, and experience record lives in `.garage/` as a readable Markdown / JSON / YAML file. Stop using garage-agent tomorrow and your data still opens in any text editor.
- **Three first-class hosts** — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode. Same pack, same skills, same memory — `garage init --hosts claude,cursor,opencode --yes` materializes everything into each host's native directory.
- **A complete memory loop** — `garage sync` pushes your top knowledge + recent experience into each host's context surface (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.opencode/AGENTS.md`); `garage session import --from <host>` pulls host conversation history back for extraction.
- **Skill packs that travel** — 4 packs ship in v0.1.0 (`garage` / `coding` / `writing` / `search`) with **33 skills + 3 production agents**. Install third-party packs from any git URL; publish your own with `garage pack publish`.
- **The system suggests its own next skill** — When the same `(problem_domain, tag)` pattern shows up in 5+ sessions, `garage skill suggest` proposes a SKILL.md draft. `garage skill promote` turns it into a real pack skill.
- **Workflow recall** — `garage recall workflow --problem-domain cli-design` returns the skill chains that have actually worked for similar past tasks, ranked by frequency.
- **Privacy-respecting share** — `garage pack publish` runs a sensitive-pattern scan before pushing; `garage knowledge export --anonymize` lets you share what you've learned without leaking secrets.
- **Human-in-charge** — Destructive and shareable operations are explicit (`--yes` / `--force` / `--anonymize`). The system suggests; you decide.

## What's in the box (v0.1.0)

| Pack | Version | Skills | Agents | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `packs/garage/` | 0.3.0 | 3 | 3 | Onboarding (`garage-hello` / `find-skills` / `writing-skills`) + production agents (`code-review-agent` / `blog-writing-agent` / `garage-sample-agent`) |
| `packs/coding/` | 0.4.0 | 24 | 0 | The full HarnessFlow engineering workflow (spec → design → tasks → TDD → review → finalize), reverse-synced from `harness-flow v0.1.0` |
| `packs/writing/` | 0.2.0 | 5 | 0 | `blog-writing` / `humanizer-zh` / `hv-analysis` / `khazix-writer` / `magazine-web-ppt` |
| `packs/search/` | 0.1.0 | 1 | 0 | `ai-weekly` (X/Twitter weekly curation in Chinese) |

`garage init --hosts all` materializes **99 skill files + 6 agent files** (33 skills × 3 hosts; agents to claude + opencode only — Cursor has no agent surface yet).

## Install

`garage-agent` requires Python 3.11+ and `uv` (recommended) or `pip`.

```bash
# clone + install in an isolated uv-managed venv (recommended)
git clone https://github.com/hujianbest/garage-agent.git
cd garage-agent
uv sync
uv run garage --help

# or, pip-style editable install from a clone
pip install -e .

# PyPI (once published — see release notes for status)
pip install garage-agent
```

> The PyPI distribution name is **`garage-agent`** (`pip install garage-agent`) but the Python import path is **`garage_os`** (`import garage_os`). Same pattern as Pillow / `import PIL`.

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

```bash
# 1) materialize all 4 packs into Claude Code + Cursor + OpenCode
garage init --hosts claude,cursor,opencode --yes

# 2) check what landed
garage status

# 3) push your top knowledge + recent experience into each host's context surface
garage sync --hosts claude,cursor,opencode

# 4) (after a few sessions) pull host history back for memory extraction
garage session import --from claude --all

# 5) ask: which workflow paths have worked for similar problems?
garage recall workflow --problem-domain cli-design

# 6) and: did the system spot any patterns worth turning into skills?
garage skill suggest --rescan
```

That's it — open Claude Code, Cursor, or OpenCode in the same directory and the skills + memory are already there.

## How the flywheel works

1. **You work.** Conversations happen in your host of choice. Garage's `session import` reads them back.
2. **The system extracts.** Repeated patterns and decisions become candidate `knowledge/` entries (decisions / patterns / solutions / style) and `experience/` records.
3. **You review.** Nothing enters long-term memory without `garage memory review`. The user-pact is explicit: the human keeps the steering wheel.
4. **The system pushes back.** `garage sync` writes your top-N knowledge into `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursor/rules/garage-context.mdc` / `.opencode/AGENTS.md`, so the next conversation starts already knowing what you know.
5. **Patterns become skills.** When 5+ sessions hit the same `(problem_domain, tag)` cluster, `garage skill suggest` proposes a draft. You review, refine via `hf-test-driven-dev`, and `garage skill promote` it into a pack.
6. **Skills become shareable.** `garage pack publish --to <git-url>` ships your pack with sensitive-pattern scan and force-push prompt. Other people `garage pack install <git-url>` to pull it.

## Pack lifecycle

```bash
# install someone else's pack from any git URL
garage pack install https://github.com/<user>/<their-pack>.git

# list installed packs (shows source_url for installed-from-URL packs)
garage pack ls

# update from source_url
garage pack update <pack-id> --yes

# publish (sensitive-pattern scan + force-push prompt + 7 anonymization rules)
garage pack publish <pack-id> --to https://github.com/<you>/<pack-name>.git --yes

# clean uninstall (reverse-installs from every host directory)
garage pack uninstall <pack-id> --yes

# share what you've learned, anonymized
garage knowledge export --anonymize
```

## Roadmap

v0.1.0 closes 14 delivery cycles (F001–F014). Snapshot of where we are vs. the manifesto:

```
Belief 1  Data is yours       █████████████████████████████████  5/5  ✅
Belief 2  Host portability    █████████████████████████          4/5  ⚠️ 4th host still requires source edit
Belief 3  Progressive enhance █████████████████████████████████  5/5  ✅
Belief 4  Human + machine     █████████████████████████████████  5/5  ✅ flywheel closed
Belief 5  Shareable           █████████████████████████████████  5/5  ✅ install / update / publish / anonymize

Stage 1  Toolbox     ████████████████████  100%
Stage 2  Memory      ████████████████████  100%
Stage 3  Craftsman   █████████████          65%   ← skill mining shipped, manual refinement still required
Stage 4  Ecosystem   ████████               40%   ← lifecycle complete; signature + discovery still pending
```

**v0.2 candidates** (in priority order):

1. Real 3-way merge for `pack update --preserve-local-edits`
2. Pluggable host registry (drop the source-edit requirement for a 4th host)
3. Pack signature / GPG + `garage pack search` central discovery
4. Cross-machine `garage sync` with git-aware merging
5. `ruff` + `mypy` cleanup → re-add as blocking CI jobs
6. Cursor session history reader (currently a stub)

See [`docs/planning/`](docs/planning/) for full gap analysis.

## A note on the name

A garage is where things start before they're polished — close to the work, shaped by iteration, able to grow into something real without losing its identity along the way. `garage-agent` is the place where your agent capability can be **built by hand**, **compounded over time**, and eventually **leave the garage** without being thrown away.

It's deliberately not a SaaS product, not a single-host wrapper, not a generic all-in-one framework, and not full autopilot. It's a workshop.

## License

[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE). Chosen for the explicit patent grant and downstream-friendliness — aligned with the manifesto's "your data, your skills, your right to share them" stance.

## Acknowledgments

`garage-agent` stands on the shoulders of the open-source agent community. The HarnessFlow workflow chain in `packs/coding/` reverse-syncs from [`hujianbest/harness-flow`](https://github.com/hujianbest/harness-flow). Design influences are documented honestly in [`docs/wiki/`](docs/wiki/), including comparative analysis of Hermes Agent, OpenSpec, gstack, get-shit-done, longtaskforagent, and Superpowers.

Built for everyone who wanted their agent to **remember last month**, **know their style**, and **come with them when they switch tools**.
